# Four Color Theorem Project

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a Haskell program that solves the Four Color Theorem by coloring maps using only four colors. The program allows users to load different text files containing maps and analyzes them to find valid color assignments.

The implementation consists of two main phases:
1. **Map Analysis**: Load a valid text file representing a map and analyze it to obtain the adjacency list of zones.
2. **Solution Search**: Utilize backtracking to find a valid coloring solution for the map with a maximum of four colors.

## Usage

To use the program, execute `CuatroColores.exe` and provide a map file located in the `./mapas` directory. A selection of maps with varying difficulty levels is available for testing.

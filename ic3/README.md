This project involves designing and implementing digital circuits using VHDL for two specific tasks:
1. Implementation of logic functions F and G based on the following truth table:
| x | y | z | F | G |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

2. Design of a combinational circuit for signed binary addition with overflow detection.
    - Implement n-bit adder with carry-in
    - Design overflow detection logic
    - Implement zero and sign detection
